    "### 2. Similarity-based algorithms\n",
    "When dealing with data, we often need to define how much a data point is similar to other data points. If we know how similar or dissimilar any two data points are, we can then divide the data points into groups where the elements in the same group are similar. and thus achieve machine learning. *Classification* and *clustering* are two groups of similarity-based machine learning algorithms. How good the classification or clustering result is almost always depends on how suitable the similarity metric is.\n",

    "#### Expectation-Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "In k-means (clustering), we use a technique in which the centres are guessed, the data points are assigned the guessed centres, then the centres are updated according to the information that has been gathered thus far, and the procedure repeats until the result *converges*. This algorithm is actually a way of making educated and systematic trial-and-error guesses. There is a highly similar algorithm known as Expectation-Maximization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectation-Maximization is usually said to the the \"soft\" version of k-means. That means, instead assigning a data point to one and only one cluster, *a data point is assigned to all clusters with probability densities*; instead of characterising a cluster by its mean, a cluster is to be characterised by a *probability density function* or *mixtures of probability density functions*. The suitability that a data point belongs to a cluster depends on how it fits with the probability density functions of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually assume the probability density function is of [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main steps of expectation-maximization:\n",
    "1. Expectation, the E step: for each data point $d_i$, compute the probability density of it belonging to each of the clusters give the current model $m$\n",
    "2. Maximization, the M step: update the model $m$ such that every data point can be assigned to a cluster with the greatest probability density (in other words, to make clusters further away from each other)"
