When you want to use a class in one of your programs, you make an **object** from that class, which is where the phrase \"object-oriented\" comes from. Python itself is not tied to object-oriented programming, but you will be using objects in most or all of your Python projects. In order to understand classes, you have to understand some of the language that is used in OOP."

The rules for naming a class are the same rules you learned about [naming variables](var_string_num.html#naming_rules), but there is a strong convention among Python programmers that classes should be named using CamelCase. If you are unfamiliar with CamelCase, it is a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name. The name of the class is followed by a set of parentheses. These parentheses will be empty for now, but later they may contain a class upon which the new class is based.\n",

There is a [more formal syntax](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for documenting your classes, but you can wait a little bit to get that formal. For now, just write a comment at the beginning of your class summarizing what you intend the class to do. Writing more formal documentation for your classes will be easy later if you start by writing simple comments now.\n",

    "One of the most important goals of the object-oriented approach to programming is the creation of stable, reliable, reusable code. If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can **inherit** from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the **parent** class, and the new class is a **child** of the parent class. The parent class is also called a **superclass**, and the child class is also called a **subclass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child class inherits all attributes and behavior from the parent class, but any attributes that are defined in the child class are not available to the parent class. This may be obvious to many people, but it is worth stating. This also means a child class can override behavior of the parent class. If a child class defines a method that also appears in the parent class, objects of the child class will use the new method rather than the parent class method.\n",
